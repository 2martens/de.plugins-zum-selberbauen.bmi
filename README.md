Size-Weight-BMI
===================

A plugin that adds two custom profile fields editable upon registration.
One field is labeled weight and the other size. They are used to calculate the BMI
which is then displayed in the message sidebar under the avatar of the specific user*.

* This does not happen automatically. After installation you have to navigate to System -> Options -> Messages.
There you will find a selection for all profile fields that shall be displayed in the message sidebar. 
Select BMI here and it will be shown in the message sidebar.
